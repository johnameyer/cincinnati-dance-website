    At CDMC, dancers of all ages and ability levels can express themselves through the art of dance. With our caring, expert faculty and our state-of-the-art facility, we offer a wide range of classes to meet the needs of a diverse student body, from children experiencing their first dance class to professionals wanting to brush up on their technique. 
    <br>
    We provide classes for ages two through adults, beginning through advanced, as well as performance teams for students who wish to gain performance experience without the stress and expense of entering dance competitions.

    At the Cincinnati Dance and Movement Center, everyone is welcomed.  Come dance with us!
