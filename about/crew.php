							<h1>Our Faculty/Staff</h1>
							<br>
							<p>At CDMC, classes are taught by adult dance teachers with college-level training in dance and
								education. Unlike many studios, we do not hire high school students to teach the younger childrenâ€™s
								classes; they may only serve as assistants to the adult teachers in charge. Our teachers are not only
								outstanding dancers (having been professional dancers, members of their university dance teams, and
								award-winning competitive dancers), but are also outstanding educators. Our teaching faculty has
								won numerous teaching and choreography awards on the local, regional, and even national level.
								Additionally, our faculty members regularly attend master classes and teaching workshops to stay on
								top of current dance trends and teaching methods.</p>
